                        Coinciding with the opening of Bruce Nauman’s (MFA ’66, UC
                        Davis) retrospective at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, this
                        exhibition features the first realization of a participatory environment
                        Nauman conceived in 1970. The work is a narrow passageway that
                        wraps around an existing room, combining colored fluorescent light
                        and closed-circuit video to manipulate the viewer’s perceptual experience.
                        An adjacent gallery includes artworks that situate the corridor
                        within the artist’s career.

                    Few living artists have done as much to expand the boundaries of art since 1960
                    as Bruce Nauman. During the mid-late 1960s - beginning with his time as a graduate
                    student in the UC Davis studio art program, where he received his MA in 1966 -
                    Nauman was at the forefront of a generation of artists that placed process and activity
                    over static, predetermined forms, and that took up language and the body as
                    materials. Unbound by traditional divisions of medium, Nauman has moved freely
                    between sculpture, performance, film, video, photography, drawing, printmaking,
                    and large-scale installation.

                    This exhibition coincides with a major Nauman retrospective, co-organized by The
                    Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the Schaulager Basel, the artist's first in over
                    twenty years. While the retrospective provides an opportunity to survey the full
                    breadth of Nauman's work, the present exhibition at the Manetti Shrem Museum
                    focuses on a single, exceptional artwork: a large-scale participatory environment
                    from 1970-71. Between 1969 and 1976, Nauman designed some forty corridors,
                    rooms, and other architectural installations. The majority of these installations have
                    been built for exhibition on at least one occasion, but Blue and Yellow Corridor is
                    one of a handful that have remained on paper, in the form of drawings by the artist.
                    Although Nauman originally developed the concept for this particular work in three
                    drawings of 1970-1971, this exhibition
